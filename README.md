# OpenBooking

## What it does

OpenBooking is a blockchain-based reservation platform that connects customers with service providers. It offers a decentralized solution for booking appointments, making deposits, and managing reservations using smart contracts.

## The problem it solves

OpenBooking addresses several issues in the traditional booking industry:

- Lack of transparency in reservation processes
- High fees charged by centralized booking platforms
- Trust issues between customers and service providers
- Inefficient management of deposits and cancellations

## Challenges I ran into

- Implementing a user-friendly interface for blockchain interactions
- Ensuring seamless integration between frontend and smart contracts
- Optimizing gas fees for various blockchain operations
- Designing a flexible system to accommodate different types of services and businesses

## Technologies I used

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Blockchain: Ethereum (and other EVM-compatible networks)
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Web3 Integration: thirdweb SDK
- Version Control: Git

## How we built it

1. Designed the smart contract architecture for reservations and payments
2. Developed and tested smart contracts using Hardhat and Ethers.js
3. Created a responsive frontend using Next.js and Tailwind CSS
4. Integrated thirdweb SDK for seamless blockchain interactions
5. Implemented separate interfaces for customers and businesses
6. Conducted thorough testing and optimization for gas efficiency

## What we learned

- The intricacies of developing decentralized applications (dApps)
- Balancing user experience with blockchain functionality
- The importance of gas optimization in smart contract design
- Strategies for effective state management in a decentralized system

## What's next for OpenBooking

- Mobile app development for increased accessibility
- Integration with popular calendar systems
- Multi-chain support to offer users more blockchain options
